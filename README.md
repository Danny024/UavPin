An Intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle For Detection of Pipeline Faults
## Abstract
Leakages on Pipeline continues to be a problem in the petroleum sector, but this research presents the use of state of the art techniques in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence to tacke this menace. This project makes use of an intelligent drone enabled by computer vision algorithm to detect pipeline faults.
The Drone is able to perform the following
1. Real time 3D Reconstruction of the environment
2. Detection of Pipelien Faults using Computer Vision algorithm
3. Obstacle avoidance during drone navigation
4. Tracking of Pipeline path using Path Dijkstra's and A* algorithm
